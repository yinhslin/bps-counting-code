run.m iterates over levels and degrees in a single job
runX.m fixes charges and iterates over degrees in each job
runY.m fixes charges and degree in each job

multitraceX.m is used in place of multitrace.m (DEPRECIATED) if multitracechargelist.m is run

multitraceZ.m parallelizes multitraceX.m such that each job runs a subset of charges in multitracechargelist
multitraceY.m then collects those separate results and combine them into one file

countX.m and cohomologyX.m are used in place of count.m and cohomology.m if we do not care about gravitons vs non-gravitons
I don't think we care about Y and Z for count and cohomology
